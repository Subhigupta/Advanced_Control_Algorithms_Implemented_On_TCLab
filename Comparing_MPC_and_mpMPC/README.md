**Basic understanding of design and tuning parameters of MPC**
- QR, R1, OH, NC are the tuning parameters in this project.
- Weighting matrix QR alolws (T- Tsp) to be weighted individually.
- Weigthing matrix R1 allows change in control input (u(k)-u(k-1)) to be weighted individually.
- OH is prediction horizon.
- NC is control horizon.
- The plots in figures folder illustrates how the tuning of parameters affect the trajectory of output variables.
- If elements of weighting matrix QR are changed then the settling time of the trajectory of output variables changes.
- If elements of weighting matrix R1 are changed then the smoothness of the input/manipulated variables curve changes.
- Changing OH helps you predict future from current kth state to (k+OH)th state. Predicting into far future helps you generate better controlled moves.
- NC in this project is taken equal to OH.Defining NC means generating control moves from cuurent kth state to (k+NC-1)th state.
