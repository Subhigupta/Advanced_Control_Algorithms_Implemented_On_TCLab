# Model_Predictive_control_On_TCLab
The codes in this file demonstrate implementation of State-Space MPC, Explicit MPC and Bilevel MPC on an arduino device TCLab. 
The task performed by each of the code is described as follows:
1. Dynamic Modelling of TCLab
2. Linearising around a steady state point
3. Case Study 1
     - In the first case study, the upper level objective is minimization of a linear economic cost function while the lower level focused on tracking temperature of heater 1. 
5. Case Study 2
    - In the second case study, the upper level objective is minimization of a linear economic cost function while the lower level focused on tracking temperature of heater 2. 
7. Case Study 3
    - In the third case study, the upper level objective focuses on tracking of temperature of heater 1 while the lower level focused on tracking temperature of heater 2.
